    "notes": "## Trade Recommendation Rationale: Bull Call Spread on [Underlying Ticker]\n\n**1. Alignment with Bullish Thesis and Market Context**\n\nOur core thesis is a **medium-conviction bullish outlook** for the underlying asset, currently trading at $250.00. The Bull Call Spread is an excellent fit for this thesis because it is a **defined-risk directional strategy** designed to profit from a moderate rise in the stock price. Given that the IV Rank is moderate (50.8) and our volatility forecast suggests subdued volatility, buying a naked call would be expensive and inefficient. The Bull Call Spread allows us to participate in the upside while partially funding the long call purchase by selling a higher-strike call, thereby reducing the net debit and lowering the breakeven point compared to a simple long call. This structure capitalizes on our directional view without requiring a massive move or high implied volatility.\n\n**2. Trade Structure and Mechanics**\n\nWe are initiating a Bull Call Spread by **buying the 255-Strike Call** (the lower strike) and simultaneously **selling the 280-Strike Call** (the higher strike). This creates a spread width of $25.00. The maximum profit potential is capped at the difference between the strikes minus the net debit paid. Maximum profit is achieved if the stock closes at or above the short strike ($280.00) at expiration. The short 280-strike call acts as a profit ceiling but significantly offsets the cost of the long 255-strike call. The trade is profitable as long as the stock price exceeds the long strike plus the net premium paid (the breakeven point).\n\n**3. Key Risks and Monitoring**\n\nThe primary risk is that the stock fails to move higher, resulting in a loss of the net debit paid. Since this is a defined-risk strategy, the **maximum loss is strictly limited** to the initial net debit paid for the spread. We must monitor the stock's movement relative to the 255 strike. If the stock remains below $255.00, the trade will likely expire worthless. Furthermore, while the strategy benefits from a rise in price, it is important to note that the positive delta exposure decreases as the stock approaches the short 280 strike. If the stock rallies aggressively past $280.00, we will not capture any further upside beyond the maximum profit level. We will look to manage or close the position if the stock approaches the maximum profit target well ahead of expiration to capture time decay value.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"Bull Call Spread\",\n  \"legs\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"BUY\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 255.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.49838407816126706\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"SELL\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 280.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.29222157736485227\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
