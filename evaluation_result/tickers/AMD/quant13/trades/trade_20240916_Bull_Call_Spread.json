    "notes": "## Trade Rationale: Bull Call Spread on [Underlying Ticker]\n\n**Client:**\n\nBased on our established medium-conviction bullish thesis for the underlying asset, we are recommending a **Bull Call Spread** to capitalize on potential upside while managing premium cost and defined risk.\n\n### Strategy Alignment and Structure\n\nThe Bull Call Spread is a classic directional strategy perfectly suited for a moderate bullish outlook. By **buying the lower strike $155 Call** and simultaneously **selling the higher strike $165 Call**, we establish a net debit position that benefits directly from the stock rising above $155. The purchase of the $155 Call provides the primary exposure to the upside, while the sale of the $165 Call partially offsets the premium cost, reducing our maximum risk (the net debit paid). This structure defines our maximum profit at the difference between the strikes ($10) minus the net debit paid, and our maximum loss is strictly limited to the net debit. Given the current IV Rank of 57.3, which suggests volatility is elevated, using a spread is prudent as it mitigates the high cost of buying a naked call and reduces our sensitivity to potential IV contraction.\n\n### Risk Management and Key Considerations\n\nThe primary risk in this trade is the stock failing to move above the $155 long strike, resulting in the loss of the net premium paid. Our maximum profit is capped at the $165 strike, meaning any move beyond that level does not yield additional gains. We must monitor the stock's movement relative to our breakeven point (Long Strike + Net Debit). Given that the volatility forecast suggests IV will hold marginally above long-run norms, the spread structure is beneficial because the short call helps finance the long call, making the trade less sensitive to minor IV changes than a pure long call would be. We will look to manage the position proactively as the stock approaches the $165 short strike or if the bullish momentum stalls.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"Bull Call Spread\",\n  \"legs\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"BUY\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 155.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.4886746704182528\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"SELL\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 165.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.32337439290507775\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
