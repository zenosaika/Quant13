    "notes": "## Trade Rationale: Long Call Strategy (Bearish Thesis)\n\nGood morning. Based on our medium-conviction bearish thesis for the underlying asset, the recommended strategy is a **Long Call**. While a Long Call is fundamentally a bullish strategy, its selection here is purely tactical, designed to function as a **defined-risk hedge or a synthetic short put position** against our primary bearish exposure, or to capitalize on a short-term, counter-trend bounce that we believe will ultimately fail. Given the current price of $140.71 and an elevated IV Rank of 53.4, the cost of this hedge is relatively high, which is reflected in the low Selection Score of -50.0. We acknowledge the inherent mismatch between the strategy's directional bias and our core bearish outlook, but we are executing this to manage specific risk or capture a specific, non-directional outcome.\n\nThe trade structure involves **buying one $135.00 strike Call option**. This option has a high Delta of approximately 0.65, meaning it is deep in-the-money (ITM) relative to the current price. By purchasing this ITM call, we are establishing a position that has significant intrinsic value and will move closely with the underlying stock price. If this trade is intended as a hedge against a short stock position, the Long Call acts to cap our maximum loss if the market unexpectedly reverses sharply upward. If this trade is a standalone tactical play, we are essentially betting on a temporary, sharp correction or a \"dead cat bounce\" back toward the $145-$150 range before the sustained bearish move takes hold. Our maximum risk is strictly limited to the premium paid for this option, providing a defined-risk way to participate in any unexpected upside volatility.\n\nThe primary risk here is the **time decay (Theta)** and the **cost of capital**. If the stock remains flat or immediately begins its expected bearish decline, the entire premium paid for the call option will be lost. Furthermore, the high IV Rank suggests that the option premium is inflated, increasing the cost of this tactical hedge. We must monitor the $135.00 strike level closely. If the stock falls below this strike, the option will rapidly lose intrinsic value, and the effectiveness of the hedge or the tactical play diminishes quickly. We recommend setting a clear exit point for this call option, likely tied to a specific percentage loss of the premium, to ensure this tactical position does not become a drag on overall portfolio performance should our bearish thesis immediately materialize.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"Long Call\",\n  \"legs\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"BUY\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 135.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.6530123712271001\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
