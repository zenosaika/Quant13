    "notes": "## Trade Rationale: Bull Call Spread Recommendation\n\n**Alignment with Bullish Thesis and Strategy Selection**\n\nOur core thesis is moderately bullish on the underlying asset, currently trading at $157.90. Given this directional view, the **Bull Call Spread** is an excellent strategy choice because it allows us to capitalize on upward movement while defining and limiting our capital outlay. The strategy is inherently bullish, designed to profit if the stock rises, but we are choosing a defined-risk approach rather than buying a naked call. This is particularly prudent given the current low IV Rank (21.0), which suggests that volatility is subdued. While low volatility generally favors long option positions, the spread structure helps manage the cost of entry. The strategy\u2019s moderate Selection Score (40/100) reflects that while it aligns directionally, it is a conservative way to express the medium-conviction bullish view.\n\n**Trade Structure and Mechanics**\n\nThis specific Bull Call Spread involves two legs: **buying the $160 Call** and **selling the $170 Call**. By selling the higher strike call, we generate premium that partially offsets the cost of buying the lower strike call, thereby reducing our net debit (the maximum potential loss). The maximum profit potential is capped at the difference between the strikes ($10.00) minus the net debit paid. The trade begins to profit once the stock moves above the lower strike ($160.00) plus the net debit paid. The maximum profit is achieved if the stock closes at or above the short strike of $170.00 at expiration. This structure defines our risk precisely and provides a favorable risk/reward profile for a moderate move higher.\n\n**Key Risks and Monitoring**\n\nThe primary risk, as with any debit spread, is that the stock fails to move higher. If the stock remains below the long strike of $160.00, the spread will expire worthless, and we will lose the entire net premium paid. A secondary risk is opportunity cost: if the stock experiences a massive rally significantly above $170.00, our profit is capped, and we would have earned more with a simple long call. Given the subdued volatility environment, we must monitor the stock's price action closely. If the stock moves quickly toward the $160 strike, we may consider holding to maximize the spread's value. However, if the stock stagnates or moves lower, we should be prepared to exit the position early to salvage any remaining time value, rather than waiting for the full loss at expiration.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"Bull Call Spread\",\n  \"legs\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"BUY\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 160.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.49300403484480176\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"SELL\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 170.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.29573490521879375\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
