    "notes": "## Trade Rationale: Long Call Strategy Against a Bearish Thesis\n\nGood morning. Based on our medium-conviction bearish thesis for the underlying asset, currently priced at $141.13, we are implementing a **Long Call** strategy. It is critical to note upfront that this strategy is fundamentally counter-directional to our primary bearish outlook. A Long Call is a maximum bullish conviction play, meaning its primary function is to profit from a significant upward move. **Therefore, the rationale for this specific trade is not to profit from the bearish thesis, but rather to serve as a highly leveraged, defined-risk hedge or a \"contrarian lottery ticket\" against a potential short squeeze or a sudden, unexpected reversal in market sentiment.** Given the IV Rank of 43.2, volatility is moderate, allowing us to purchase this option without excessive premium cost.\n\nThe trade structure involves buying a single **Call option at the $135.00 strike price**. This is an in-the-money (ITM) call, evidenced by its high Delta of approximately 0.67. By buying an ITM call, we are acquiring an option that already has significant intrinsic value, making the premium paid less susceptible to immediate time decay compared to an out-of-the-money option. The maximum risk on this trade is strictly limited to the premium paid for the call. If the stock price falls, aligning with our bearish thesis, the option will expire worthless (or near worthless), and we lose only the premium. However, if the market violently reverses and the stock moves significantly higher, this long call provides substantial, leveraged upside participation to offset potential losses in other bearish positions or to capture the unexpected rally.\n\nThe primary risk is the **mismatch between the strategy and the thesis.** If our medium-conviction bearish thesis plays out, this Long Call will lose 100% of its premium, resulting in a defined loss. We must also be mindful of time decay (Theta), which will erode the value of the option daily, especially as expiration approaches. We will monitor the stock closely for any signs of a technical breakout above the $145 level, which would validate the hedge. If the stock continues to decline as anticipated, we will treat the premium paid as the cost of the insurance against a short squeeze and allow the position to decay, or potentially close it early to recover some remaining extrinsic value.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"Long Call\",\n  \"legs\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"BUY\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 135.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.6667318465631983\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
