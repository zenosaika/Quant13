    "notes": "## Trade Rationale: Bull Call Spread on [Underlying Asset]\n\n**Thesis Alignment and Strategy Selection**\n\nOur core thesis is moderately bullish on the underlying asset, currently trading at $156.75. To capitalize on this expected upward movement while managing premium costs and defined risk, we are recommending a **Bull Call Spread**. This strategy perfectly aligns with a bullish outlook where we anticipate the stock will move higher, but perhaps not dramatically so, or where we want to limit our capital outlay. Given the IV Rank is around 50, implying moderate implied volatility, the spread structure allows us to buy the necessary upside exposure (via the long call) and partially finance it by selling the higher strike call, which caps our maximum profit but significantly reduces the net debit required.\n\n**Trade Structure and Mechanics**\n\nThe proposed trade is a 160/170 Bull Call Spread. We will **BUY the 160 Call** and simultaneously **SELL the 170 Call**. The 160 strike is slightly out-of-the-money (OTM) but has a high delta (approx. 0.48), meaning it will quickly gain value if the stock moves toward our target. The sale of the 170 Call, which has a lower delta (approx. 0.32), defines our maximum profit at the difference between the strikes ($10.00) minus the net debit paid. The maximum risk is limited to the net debit paid upfront. This structure provides a favorable risk/reward profile for a moderate bullish move, aiming for the stock to finish above $170 by expiration to achieve maximum profitability.\n\n**Key Risks and Monitoring**\n\nThe primary risk is that the stock fails to move above the long strike ($160) or moves lower, resulting in the loss of the entire net debit paid. Since this is a debit spread, time decay (Theta) will work against us, though the short call partially mitigates this effect. We must also be mindful of volatility. While our forecast is stable, a sharp unexpected drop in implied volatility could negatively impact the value of the spread, although the defined-risk nature protects against catastrophic losses. We will monitor the stock's price action relative to the $160 break-even point and the $170 maximum profit level, prepared to exit the trade early if the bullish momentum stalls or reverses.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"Bull Call Spread\",\n  \"legs\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"BUY\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 160.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.48190660436911836\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"SELL\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 170.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.31652167896845684\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
