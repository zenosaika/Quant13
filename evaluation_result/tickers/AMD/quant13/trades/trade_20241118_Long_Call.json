    "notes": "## Trade Rationale: Long Call Strategy Against a Bearish Thesis\n\nGood morning. Based on our medium-conviction bearish thesis for the underlying asset, the proposed strategy is a **Long Call** at the $135.00 strike. On the surface, this strategy appears fundamentally mismatched with our directional view, as a Long Call is typically a maximum bullish conviction play designed to profit from significant upward movement. We must acknowledge this conflict immediately: **a Long Call is inherently a bullish instrument, and its selection here runs directly counter to our established bearish outlook.** The selection score of -50.0 strongly reinforces this concern, indicating a high probability of directional error if our bearish thesis proves correct.\n\nGiven the constraint to maintain the bearish thesis, the only viable rationale for initiating a Long Call is to use it as a **highly specific, tactical hedge against a sudden, sharp reversal or \"short squeeze\" scenario**, rather than a primary profit driver. Alternatively, it could be a deliberate attempt to capitalize on a short-term technical bounce *before* the expected bearish move takes hold, or perhaps a bet on implied volatility expansion (though the IV Rank of 48.2 suggests stable volatility). The trade structure involves **buying the 135.00 strike Call option**, which has a current Delta of approximately 0.62. This means we are buying an in-the-money or near-the-money option, giving us immediate positive exposure to upward price movement. Our maximum risk is limited to the premium paid for the call, while the potential profit is theoretically unlimited if the stock moves significantly higher.\n\nThe primary risk here is directional: **if our medium-conviction bearish thesis is correct, this trade will lose money.** If the stock declines, the premium paid for the call will erode rapidly, resulting in a 100% loss of capital allocated to this leg. Furthermore, while the IV Rank is moderate, if volatility contracts (which often happens during a steady decline), the option's value will suffer from negative Vega. We must closely monitor the $138.93 current price level. If the stock begins to move lower, consistent with our bearish view, this Long Call position should be liquidated quickly to preserve capital. This trade should be viewed strictly as a tactical, high-risk deviation or hedge, not a core component of a bearish strategy.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"Long Call\",\n  \"legs\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"BUY\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 135.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.6212392264359008\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
