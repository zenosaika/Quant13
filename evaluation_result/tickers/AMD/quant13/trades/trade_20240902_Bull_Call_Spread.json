    "notes": "## Trade Rationale: Bull Call Spread on [Underlying Ticker]\n\n**Client:**\n\nBased on our medium-conviction Bullish thesis for the underlying asset, we are recommending a **Bull Call Spread** to capitalize on anticipated upward movement while managing premium expenditure and elevated volatility.\n\n### Strategy Alignment and Structure\n\nThe Bull Call Spread is a classic defined-risk strategy perfectly suited for a directional bullish outlook when we expect the stock to move higher, but perhaps not explosively so. By **buying the 150-strike Call** (near-the-money) and simultaneously **selling the 165-strike Call** (out-of-the-money), we establish a net debit position. This structure significantly reduces the upfront cost compared to buying a naked call, as the premium received from selling the 165-strike partially offsets the premium paid for the 150-strike. Our maximum profit is achieved if the stock closes at or above the 165 strike at expiration, and our maximum loss is limited to the net debit paid. This strategy is ideal given the current IV Rank of 68.3, as selling the higher strike helps mitigate the cost inflation driven by high implied volatility.\n\n### Risk Management and Key Considerations\n\nWhile this strategy aligns with our bullish view, it is crucial to understand the constraints. The primary risk is that the stock fails to move above the 150 strike, resulting in a loss of the net premium paid. Furthermore, the maximum profit is capped at the width of the strikes ($15.00) minus the net debit. Given the elevated IV environment, we must be mindful that if volatility collapses unexpectedly, the value of the spread could decline even if the stock price moves sideways. We are comfortable with the current volatility forecast suggesting it will hold marginally above long-run norms, which supports the structure. We will monitor the stock's movement relative to the 150 strike, as this is our critical break-even point.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"Bull Call Spread\",\n  \"legs\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"BUY\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 150.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.5169852154831991\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"SELL\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 165.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.2825026010353549\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
