    "notes": "## Trade Rationale: Bull Call Spread on [Underlying Ticker]\n\n**1. Strategy Alignment and Thesis Justification**\n\nOur core thesis is **Bullish** with medium conviction, believing the underlying asset, currently at \\$170.97, will appreciate over the trade horizon. The **Bull Call Spread** is an excellent fit for this outlook because it is a defined-risk, directional strategy designed to profit from a moderate rise in the stock price. By buying the \\$175 Call and simultaneously selling the \\$185 Call, we establish a net debit position that maximizes profit if the stock closes above the higher strike (\\$185) at expiration, while limiting our upfront cost (the premium paid). Given the IV Rank of 45.1, volatility is moderate, making a debit spread an efficient way to gain exposure without paying the high premiums associated with outright long calls in high-IV environments.\n\n**2. Trade Structure and Mechanics**\n\nThis trade is structured as a 10-point wide Bull Call Spread. We are **buying the 175 Call** (the long leg) to establish our bullish exposure and define our maximum potential profit. We are simultaneously **selling the 185 Call** (the short leg) to partially finance the purchase and reduce the overall cost of the trade. The maximum risk is limited to the net debit paid (the premium difference between the two legs). The maximum profit is the width of the strikes (\\$10.00) minus the net debit paid. The trade reaches its maximum profitability if the stock price moves above \\$185 by expiration. The breakeven point is the lower strike (\\$175) plus the net debit paid.\n\n**3. Key Risks and Monitoring**\n\nThe primary risk is that the stock remains flat or declines, resulting in the loss of the entire net debit paid. Unlike an outright long call, the short 185 Call caps our upside potential; if the stock rallies significantly past \\$185, we do not participate in that move beyond the maximum profit level. We must monitor the stock's movement relative to the \\$175 strike. If the stock fails to move above \\$175, the trade will likely expire worthless. We recommend setting a target to take profits once 50-60% of the maximum potential gain is achieved, as the final push to maximum profit often involves significant theta decay and gamma risk near expiration.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"Bull Call Spread\",\n  \"legs\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"BUY\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 175.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.4713647669331085\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"SELL\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 185.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.315304591117164\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
