    "notes": "Subject: Trade Recommendation: Bull Call Spread on [Underlying Ticker]\n\nDear Client,\n\nBased on our medium-conviction **Bullish thesis** for the underlying asset, we are recommending a **Bull Call Spread** strategy. This strategy is specifically designed to profit from a moderate upward move in the stock price while defining our maximum risk exposure. Given the current price of $174.53, a Bull Call Spread allows us to participate in the upside potential without the high cost of buying an outright call option, making it an efficient way to capitalize on our directional view.\n\nThe trade structure involves two legs: **buying the 175.0 Call** and simultaneously **selling the 180.0 Call**. By buying the lower strike and selling the higher strike, we establish a net debit position, which represents our maximum possible loss (the premium paid). The maximum profit is capped at the difference between the strikes ($5.00) minus the net debit paid. This structure targets a move above $175.00, with maximum profitability achieved if the stock closes at or above $180.00 by expiration. The strategy's defined risk profile is particularly suitable given the accelerating realized volatility, as it limits the impact of any sharp adverse moves.\n\nThe primary risk is that the stock remains below the long strike of $175.00, resulting in the loss of the entire net premium paid. We must also monitor the accelerating volatility; while our strategy is defined risk, high volatility can lead to rapid premium decay if the stock moves sideways. We will be watching for the stock to quickly move past the $175.00 level to put the trade into profit. This spread offers a balanced approach, providing leveraged exposure to our bullish view while strictly controlling the capital at risk.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"Bull Call Spread\",\n  \"legs\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"BUY\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 175.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.5235925774612165\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"SELL\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 180.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.36501508858542375\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
