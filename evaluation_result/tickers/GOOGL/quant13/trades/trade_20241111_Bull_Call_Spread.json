    "notes": "Subject: Trade Recommendation: Bull Call Spread on [Underlying Ticker]\n\nDear [Client Name],\n\nGiven our medium-conviction **Bullish thesis** on the underlying asset, we are recommending a **Bull Call Spread** strategy. This strategy is perfectly aligned with our expectation that the stock price will appreciate moderately over the duration of the trade. The Bull Call Spread allows us to capitalize on this upward movement while defining and limiting our maximum risk exposure, making it a capital-efficient way to express a directional view. Furthermore, with an IV Rank of 31.7, implied volatility is not excessively high, making the purchase of the long call reasonable, and the sale of the short call helps finance the position and reduce the overall cost basis.\n\nThe trade structure involves two legs: **Buying the 180-Strike Call** and **Selling the 185-Strike Call**, both expiring on the same date. This creates a five-point wide spread. We pay a net debit to enter this position, which represents our maximum potential loss. The trade achieves its maximum profit if the stock closes at or above the short strike of $185 at expiration. By selling the 185-strike call, we cap our upside potential, but in return, the premium received significantly lowers the cost of the long 180-strike call, improving the probability of profit compared to buying a naked call.\n\nThe primary risk is that the stock fails to move above the long strike of $180, resulting in a loss of the net premium paid. While our thesis is Bullish, the accelerating realized volatility is a factor to monitor; if this volatility drives the price sharply lower, the spread will lose value quickly. We must also acknowledge that by selling the 185-strike call, we forgo any potential gains if the stock rallies significantly above that level. This trade is designed for a moderate, measured move higher, not a parabolic breakout. We will manage this position closely and look to take profits once the stock approaches the short strike or if the time value erodes favorably.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"Bull Call Spread\",\n  \"legs\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"BUY\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 180.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.5248095333490925\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"SELL\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 185.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.36402850993782837\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
