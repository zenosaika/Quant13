    "notes": "## Trade Rationale: Long Call Strategy (Bearish Thesis)\n\nGood morning. Based on our medium-conviction bearish thesis for the underlying asset, we are recommending a **Long Call** strategy. This selection, despite being fundamentally a bullish structure, is being employed here as a **contrarian or hedging play** against a potential short position, or as a highly targeted bet on a short-term technical bounce within a broader downtrend. Given the current price of $148.06 and an IV Rank near 50, we are looking to capitalize on a scenario where the market might experience a temporary relief rally before continuing its decline, or simply to define our maximum risk on the upside. It is critical to note that the strategy's selection score of -50.0 explicitly flags the inherent mismatch between a Long Call and a Bearish thesis, indicating this is a high-risk, non-standard application.\n\nThe proposed trade structure involves **buying one Call option at the $145.00 strike price**. This option has a Delta of approximately 0.64, meaning it is currently in-the-money (ITM) and will move roughly $0.64 for every $1.00 move in the underlying stock. The maximum risk on this trade is strictly limited to the premium paid for the call. If the stock falls as per our primary bearish thesis, the call option will expire worthless or near worthless, and we will lose the premium. However, if the stock unexpectedly reverses course or experiences a sharp upward spike, this Long Call provides leveraged exposure to that upside movement, potentially offsetting losses from a core short position or serving as a defined-risk directional bet on a counter-trend move.\n\nThe primary risk here is the **directional mismatch**; if our bearish thesis plays out, this trade will lose its entire premium, resulting in a 100% loss on the capital allocated to this option leg. Furthermore, as a long option position, it is subject to **time decay (Theta)**, meaning the option loses value every day, requiring the underlying stock to move quickly and significantly in the opposite direction of our primary thesis just to break even. We must monitor the stock closely for any signs of a technical breakdown or continuation of the bearish trend, as that would necessitate closing this call position quickly to preserve capital before time decay accelerates. This is a speculative, defined-risk hedge or counter-trend bet, and should be sized accordingly.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"Long Call\",\n  \"legs\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"BUY\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 145.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.6394014345457446\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
