    "notes": "## Trade Recommendation: Bull Call Spread (Ticker: [Client to Insert])\n\n**Rationale for Strategy Selection**\n\nOur core thesis remains **Bullish** on the underlying asset, and we are recommending a **Bull Call Spread** to capitalize on this expected upward movement. This strategy is a defined-risk, directional play perfectly aligned with our medium-conviction bullish outlook. Given the current IV Rank of 1.5, implied volatility is extremely low. While this typically favors long premium strategies, we are using a spread to maintain capital efficiency and define our maximum risk. The structure allows us to profit if the stock rises, while the sale of the higher strike call partially offsets the cost of the long call, making the entry cost lower than a naked long call.\n\n**Trade Structure and Mechanics**\n\nWe are initiating a Bull Call Spread by **buying the 165.0 Call** and simultaneously **selling the 170.0 Call**. This creates a spread width of $5.00. The long 165.0 Call provides us with the primary exposure to the upside, while the short 170.0 Call caps our maximum profit but reduces the net debit paid. Our maximum potential profit is the width of the strikes ($5.00) minus the net debit paid for the spread. The trade reaches its maximum profit if the stock closes at or above $170.00 at expiration, and the break-even point will be the lower strike ($165.00) plus the net debit paid. This structure is designed to capture a moderate move higher without requiring a significant breakout.\n\n**Key Risks and Monitoring**\n\nThe primary risk associated with this trade is that the stock remains flat or moves lower, resulting in the loss of the net debit paid. Since we are long premium on net, we benefit from time decay (Theta) only once the stock is significantly above the lower strike. A critical factor to monitor is the low volatility environment. While the low IV Rank suggests options are cheap, if realized volatility remains compressed (as the forecast suggests), the stock may not move enough to reach our profit target. We must be prepared to manage the position if the stock stalls near the current price, as the value of the spread will erode due to time decay if the underlying does not move. Our maximum loss is strictly limited to the initial net debit paid.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"Bull Call Spread\",\n  \"legs\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"BUY\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 165.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.5996015310590284\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"SELL\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 170.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.3409047451211704\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
