    "notes": "## Trade Rationale: Bull Call Spread (Ticker: [Client to Insert])\n\n**1. Strategy Alignment and Thesis Justification**\n\nGiven our **Bullish thesis** on the underlying asset, the Bull Call Spread is an ideal strategy to capitalize on anticipated upward movement while maintaining defined risk. This strategy is fundamentally directional and profits as the stock price rises toward and above the short strike. With the current price at $164.24, buying the $165 Call and selling the $170 Call allows us to establish a position just slightly out-of-the-money (OTM) for a net debit. This structure perfectly aligns with our medium conviction, as it offers a solid return profile if the stock moves higher, without requiring the massive capital outlay or unlimited risk associated with a naked long call. Furthermore, with the IV Rank at 35.5 and volatility expected to remain subdued, the defined-risk nature of the spread is preferable to strategies that rely heavily on a volatility expansion.\n\n**2. Trade Structure and Mechanics**\n\nWe are initiating a **Bull Call Spread** by **buying the 165.0 Call** (the lower strike) and simultaneously **selling the 170.0 Call** (the higher strike). This creates a 5-point wide spread. The net cost (debit) paid for this spread represents our maximum possible loss. The maximum profit is achieved if the stock closes at or above the short strike of $170.0 at expiration. This maximum profit is calculated as the width of the strikes ($5.00) minus the net debit paid. By selling the $170 Call, we partially finance the purchase of the $165 Call, significantly reducing the cost basis and improving the leverage of the trade compared to a simple long call.\n\n**3. Key Risks and Monitoring**\n\nThe primary risk is that the stock fails to move higher, resulting in a loss of the net premium paid. Since this is a debit spread, the maximum loss is strictly limited to the initial cost. The key monitoring point is the **breakeven price**, which is the long strike ($165.0) plus the net debit paid. For the trade to be profitable, the stock must exceed this breakeven point by expiration. A secondary consideration is that by capping our upside at $170.0, we forgo any potential gains if the stock experiences a massive rally beyond that level. We will monitor the delta of the spread, looking for the stock to quickly move above $165.0 to maximize time decay benefits on the short leg as we approach expiration.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"Bull Call Spread\",\n  \"legs\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"BUY\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 165.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.5123766963507599\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"SELL\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 170.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.3453190837501072\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
