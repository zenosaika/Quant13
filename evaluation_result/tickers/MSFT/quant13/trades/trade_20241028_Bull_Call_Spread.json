    "notes": "## Trade Rationale: Bull Call Spread (Bullish Thesis)\n\n**1. Alignment with Bullish Thesis and Volatility Context**\n\nOur core thesis is unequivocally **Bullish** on the underlying asset, currently trading at $422.62. The Bull Call Spread is an ideal strategy to capitalize on this directional view while managing capital efficiently. By buying the $425 Call and simultaneously selling the $435 Call, we establish a defined-risk position that profits as the underlying moves higher, specifically targeting a move into the $425 to $435 range by expiration. Furthermore, with the IV Rank at a relatively low 0.3 and realized volatility compressing, we are not paying a premium for high implied volatility. This makes the debit spread attractive, as we are buying directional exposure at a reasonable price, rather than selling premium into an elevated volatility environment.\n\n**2. Trade Structure and Mechanics**\n\nThis trade is structured as a **Bull Call Spread**, a debit spread where we pay a net premium upfront. The spread width is $10 ($435 - $425). Our maximum profit is capped at the width of the strikes minus the net debit paid. Maximum profit is achieved if the underlying closes at or above the short strike ($435) at expiration. The short $435 Call acts as a partial hedge, offsetting the cost of the long $425 Call, thereby reducing the overall capital required and defining our maximum risk. Our maximum loss is limited strictly to the net debit paid, which occurs if the underlying closes below the long strike ($425) at expiration. This structure provides a high probability of profit if our medium-conviction bullish move materializes.\n\n**3. Key Risks and Monitoring**\n\nThe primary risk is that the underlying fails to move above our long strike of $425, resulting in the maximum loss of the premium paid. Since this is a defined-risk strategy, there is no risk of assignment or margin calls beyond the initial debit. A secondary concern is the low volatility environment. While low IV makes the spread cheaper to initiate, a sudden spike in implied volatility (a \"volatility crush\") could negatively impact the value of the spread if the underlying price remains stagnant. We will monitor the underlying price action closely, looking for confirmation of the bullish momentum. If the underlying stalls below $425, we may consider closing the position early to salvage remaining time value.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"Bull Call Spread\",\n  \"legs\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"BUY\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 425.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.4975423107527755\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"SELL\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 435.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.2959481023742287\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
