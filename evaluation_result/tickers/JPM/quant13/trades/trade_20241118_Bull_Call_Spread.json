    "notes": "## Trade Rationale: Bull Call Spread on [Underlying Asset]\n\nGood morning. Based on our medium-conviction bullish thesis for the underlying asset, currently trading near $239.95, we are recommending a **Bull Call Spread** to capitalize on potential upside while managing the significant volatility environment.\n\n### Strategy Alignment and Structure\n\nThe Bull Call Spread is the ideal strategy for a defined-risk bullish outlook, especially given the current **IV Rank of 92.8**. High implied volatility makes outright long call purchases expensive. By simultaneously selling a higher-strike call, we partially finance the purchase of the lower-strike call, significantly reducing our net debit (cost) and lowering the breakeven point compared to a naked long call.\n\nThe trade structure is as follows: we are **Buying the 245 Call** and **Selling the 260 Call**. This creates a $15 wide spread. Our maximum profit is capped at the width of the strikes minus the net debit paid, realized if the stock closes at or above $260 at expiration. Our maximum risk is limited strictly to the net debit paid upfront. This structure allows us to participate in the expected move up to $260 while maintaining a fixed, known risk profile.\n\n### Risk Management and Volatility Considerations\n\nThe primary risk in this strategy is the stock failing to move above the long strike ($245) or moving sideways, resulting in the loss of the premium paid. While the strategy aligns perfectly with our bullish directional thesis, we must acknowledge the extremely high implied volatility environment. Although the spread mitigates the cost, the high IV means that if volatility collapses (a sharp drop in IV), the value of our spread could erode faster than expected, even if the stock moves slightly higher.\n\nFurthermore, we note that realized volatility is accelerating, which supports the potential for a strong directional move. We will monitor the stock's movement relative to the $245 strike. If the stock stalls below this level, we may consider an early exit to salvage remaining premium, as time decay (Theta) will accelerate against the spread as expiration approaches. This is a defined-risk play designed to capture a move into our target range of $245 to $260.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"Bull Call Spread\",\n  \"legs\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"BUY\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 245.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.4675910631807771\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"SELL\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 260.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.27890147537914267\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
