    "notes": "## Trade Recommendation: Bull Call Spread on [Underlying Asset]\n\nGood morning. Based on our established medium-conviction **Bullish thesis** for the underlying asset, currently trading at $245.10, we are recommending a **Bull Call Spread** to capitalize on the expected upward movement while managing our capital exposure.\n\n### Rationale and Strategy Alignment\n\nThe Bull Call Spread is the ideal defined-risk strategy for a moderately bullish outlook. It directly aligns with our expectation that the stock will appreciate, but it does so more efficiently than simply buying an outright call. We are initiating this trade despite the extremely high IV Rank of 87.3. While high implied volatility usually favors selling premium, the fact that *realized* volatility is accelerating above its average suggests that the market is already moving, supporting our directional conviction. By buying the lower strike call and simultaneously selling the higher strike call, we reduce the net debit required to enter the position, effectively lowering our break-even point and defining our maximum risk.\n\n### Trade Structure and Mechanics\n\nWe are executing the following spread: **Buying the 250 Call (Delta 0.47) and Selling the 265 Call (Delta 0.28).** This creates a 15-point wide spread. The long 250 Call provides the primary exposure to the upside, while the short 265 Call partially finances the purchase, reducing the net cost. Our maximum profit is capped at the width of the strikes minus the net debit paid. This maximum profit is realized if the stock closes at or above $265 at expiration. The trade will be profitable once the stock rises above our net break-even point (Long Strike + Net Debit Paid).\n\n### Key Risks and Monitoring\n\nThe primary risk is that the stock fails to move higher or moves against us. Since this is a debit spread, our maximum loss is strictly limited to the net premium paid upfront. Given the high IV environment, a rapid decline in implied volatility (IV Crush) could negatively impact the value of the spread, although the directional movement will be the dominant factor. We must monitor the price action closely; if the stock stalls or reverses significantly below the 250 strike, we may consider closing the position early to salvage remaining time value, rather than holding for the full maximum loss. This strategy is designed to capture the move between $250 and $265, and we will look to exit as we approach the maximum profit zone.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"Bull Call Spread\",\n  \"legs\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"BUY\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 250.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.4685665314348892\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"SELL\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 265.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.2773655051129327\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
