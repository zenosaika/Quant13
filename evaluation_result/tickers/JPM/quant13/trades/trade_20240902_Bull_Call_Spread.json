    "notes": "## Trade Rationale: Bull Call Spread on [Underlying]\n\n**1. Strategy Alignment and Market Context**\n\nGiven our medium-conviction **Bullish thesis** on the underlying, the Bull Call Spread is an excellent choice for capitalizing on anticipated upside while managing costs and defining risk. The strategy is inherently directional, designed to profit specifically when the underlying asset rises. With the stock currently at $218.80 and an IV Rank of 40.8, volatility is moderate, suggesting that buying options is not prohibitively expensive. By selling the higher strike call, we partially finance the purchase of the lower strike, reducing our net debit and lowering the break-even point compared to a simple long call, which is crucial when conviction is medium rather than high.\n\n**2. Trade Structure and Mechanics**\n\nWe are initiating a **Bull Call Spread** by **buying the 220.0 Call** and **selling the 230.0 Call**. This creates a 10-point wide spread. The long 220.0 Call establishes our bullish exposure, while the short 230.0 Call caps our maximum profit but generates premium to offset the cost. The maximum profit potential is the width of the strikes ($10.00) minus the net debit paid for the spread. Our maximum risk is limited precisely to the net debit paid. The trade will reach maximum profitability if the underlying closes at or above the short strike of $230.00 at expiration.\n\n**3. Key Risks and Monitoring**\n\nThe primary risk is that the underlying asset fails to move above the long strike of $220.00, resulting in a loss of the entire premium paid. Since this is a defined-risk strategy, there is no risk of margin calls or losses beyond the initial debit. We must monitor the underlying's price action closely; if the stock begins to consolidate or move lower, the time decay (Theta) will erode the value of our spread. Given the defined profit ceiling at $230.00, we should look to potentially close the position early if the underlying approaches the short strike well before expiration, as the remaining time value will diminish rapidly, and the potential reward for holding to expiration may not justify the remaining risk.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"Bull Call Spread\",\n  \"legs\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"BUY\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 220.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.506263899199146\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"SELL\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 230.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.2522152838531707\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
