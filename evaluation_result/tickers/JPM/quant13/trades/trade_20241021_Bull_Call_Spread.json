    "notes": "## Trade Rationale: Bull Call Spread on [Underlying]\n\n**Client:**\n\nBased on our current medium-conviction bullish thesis for the underlying asset, we recommend initiating a **Bull Call Spread**. This strategy is a highly efficient way to capitalize on a moderate upward move while defining our maximum risk upfront, making it an excellent fit for our directional view.\n\nThe trade structure involves **buying the 220-strike Call** and simultaneously **selling the 230-strike Call**. This is a debit spread, meaning we pay a net premium to enter the position. By buying the lower strike, we establish our primary bullish exposure (the long delta). By selling the higher strike, we partially finance the purchase and cap our maximum profit potential at the difference between the strikes minus the net debit paid. This structure is ideal because it requires the stock to move above $220.00 to become profitable, but it limits our capital outlay compared to buying a naked call, thereby improving our return on capital if the stock reaches the $230.00 level.\n\nThe primary risk is that the underlying asset remains flat or moves lower, resulting in the loss of the net premium paid. Given the current **IV Rank of 72.7**, implied volatility is elevated. While the Bull Call Spread is a volatility-neutral to slightly negative strategy (due to the short call partially offsetting the long call's vega), the high IV environment means the options are expensive. Our forecast suggests volatility will hold marginally above long-run norms, which is acceptable for this strategy. We must monitor the stock's movement closely; the maximum profit is achieved if the stock closes at or above the short strike of $230.00 at expiration.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"Bull Call Spread\",\n  \"legs\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"BUY\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 220.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.4992726254785894\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"SELL\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 230.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.2787921585295262\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
