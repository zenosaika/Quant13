    "notes": "Subject: Trade Recommendation: Bull Call Spread on [Underlying Ticker]\n\nDear [Client Name],\n\nBased on our analysis, we maintain a **medium-conviction bullish thesis** on the underlying asset. To capitalize on this expected upward movement while managing the significant volatility currently present, we recommend initiating a **Bull Call Spread**. This strategy is a defined-risk, directional play perfectly suited for a scenario where we anticipate a moderate to strong rally but want to mitigate the high cost associated with outright long calls, especially given the current **IV Rank of 100.0**. The structure allows us to participate in the upside while partially offsetting the premium decay and high implied volatility through the sale of the higher-strike call.\n\nThe proposed trade involves **buying the 235.0 Call** and simultaneously **selling the 255.0 Call**. This creates a spread with a maximum potential profit equal to the width of the strikes ($20.00) minus the net debit paid. Our maximum risk is strictly limited to the net debit paid upfront. This structure is designed to profit if the stock moves above the lower strike ($235.00) and achieves maximum profit if the stock closes at or above the upper strike ($255.00) by expiration. Given that realized volatility is accelerating, this spread allows us to leverage the directional move without exposing our capital to the full impact of potential short-term price swings that could erode the value of an unprotected long call position.\n\nThe primary risk associated with this trade is the possibility of the stock remaining flat or declining, resulting in a loss of the entire net debit paid. Furthermore, while the strategy is designed to manage high volatility, the extreme IV Rank suggests that option premiums are highly inflated. We must be mindful that if implied volatility collapses post-entry, it could negatively impact the value of our long leg more than our short leg, even if the stock moves favorably. We will monitor the price action closely, particularly around the 235.0 strike, as a sustained move below the current price would necessitate a review of the bullish thesis.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"Bull Call Spread\",\n  \"legs\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"BUY\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 235.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.5293677563544253\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"SELL\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 255.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.27704689870271504\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
