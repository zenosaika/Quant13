    "notes": "## Trade Recommendation: Bull Call Spread on [Underlying Asset]\n\n**Client Rationale:**\n\nOur core thesis is **Bullish** on the underlying asset, which is currently trading at $211.02. Given this directional conviction, the **Bull Call Spread** is an excellent strategy choice. It allows us to capitalize on a moderate upward move while defining and limiting our capital outlay. Since the IV Rank is relatively high at 62.9, selling the higher strike call helps offset the premium paid for the long call, effectively reducing our net debit and improving the potential return on capital compared to simply buying a naked call. This structure aligns perfectly with a medium-conviction bullish outlook where we seek defined risk and efficient use of capital.\n\nThe trade structure involves two legs: we are **Buying the 215.0 Call** (the lower strike, with a delta of approximately 0.44) and simultaneously **Selling the 220.0 Call** (the higher strike, with a delta of approximately 0.31). This creates a $5 wide spread. We pay a net debit to enter this position, which represents our maximum possible loss. The maximum profit is achieved if the stock closes at or above the short strike of $220.0 at expiration, and is calculated as the width of the strikes ($5.00) minus the net debit paid. This strategy provides a high probability of profit if the stock moves moderately higher, reaching our target range between $215 and $220.\n\nThe primary risk is that the stock fails to move higher or declines, resulting in the loss of the net premium paid. Since this is a defined-risk strategy, the maximum loss is known upfront. We must also be mindful of the relatively high IV Rank; while our volatility forecast is stable, a sharp collapse in implied volatility could slightly dampen the performance of the long leg. We will monitor the stock's movement relative to the long strike of $215.0, as this is the critical point where the position begins to generate intrinsic value. If the stock stalls significantly below $215.0, we may consider closing the position early to salvage remaining time value.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"Bull Call Spread\",\n  \"legs\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"BUY\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 215.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.4353987109328908\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"SELL\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 220.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.31498164223397296\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
