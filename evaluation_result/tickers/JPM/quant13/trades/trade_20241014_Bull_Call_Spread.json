    "notes": "Subject: Trade Recommendation Rationale: Bull Call Spread on [Underlying Ticker]\n\nDear Client,\n\nOur current market thesis is **Bullish** with a medium conviction. Given the underlying is trading at $216.89, we are recommending a **Bull Call Spread** to capitalize on anticipated upward movement while defining our maximum risk. This strategy perfectly aligns with a bullish outlook because it offers leveraged exposure to price appreciation up to the short strike ($230.00) and maximum profit if the price closes above that level at expiration. Furthermore, the current IV Rank of 92.2 indicates that implied volatility is exceptionally high. By selling the higher strike call, we effectively reduce the net cost of the spread, mitigating the high premium expense associated with buying options in this elevated volatility environment.\n\nThe trade structure involves buying the **$220.00 Call** and simultaneously selling the **$230.00 Call**. This creates a defined-risk, defined-reward vertical spread. The maximum potential profit is the difference between the strikes ($10.00) minus the net premium paid for the spread. The maximum loss is limited strictly to the net premium paid upfront. The short $230.00 call acts as a funding mechanism, reducing the initial debit and lowering the breakeven point compared to a simple long call purchase. This structure is designed to profit from a moderate move higher, specifically targeting a price above $230.00 by expiration.\n\nThe primary risk to monitor is the potential for the underlying price to remain flat or decline, resulting in the loss of the net premium paid. While the strategy is bullish, it has a capped profit potential; if the stock rallies significantly above $230.00, we do not participate in that additional upside. A critical factor in this trade is the high volatility environment. While the spread mitigates some premium cost, the accelerating realized volatility suggests potential for sharp price swings. We must monitor the underlying closely, as rapid movement could quickly push the trade into profit or loss. We will look to manage the position proactively if the underlying approaches either the long or short strike well before expiration.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"Bull Call Spread\",\n  \"legs\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"BUY\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 220.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.46865930255796107\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"SELL\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 230.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.26836862458257915\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
