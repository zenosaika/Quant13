    "notes": "Subject: Trade Recommendation: Bull Call Spread on [Underlying Ticker]\n\nDear [Client Name],\n\nOur current market thesis is **Bullish** with medium conviction. Given the underlying's current price of $220.83 and the low IV Rank of 21.3, which suggests options are relatively inexpensive, we recommend initiating a **Bull Call Spread**. This strategy is a defined-risk, directional play perfectly aligned with our expectation that the stock will appreciate moderately over the option's lifespan. By utilizing a spread, we capitalize on the upward movement while significantly reducing the premium cost compared to buying a naked call, making it a capital-efficient way to express our bullish view.\n\nThe trade structure involves **buying the 220.00 Call** and simultaneously **selling the 230.00 Call** in the same expiration cycle. This creates a $10 wide spread. The maximum profit is achieved if the stock closes at or above the short strike of $230.00 at expiration, and the maximum loss is limited to the net premium paid (debit) to enter the position. This structure defines both our profit ceiling and our risk floor, ensuring we know the exact potential outcomes before entering the trade. The short 230.00 Call helps finance the long 220.00 Call, lowering the break-even point compared to a simple long call.\n\nThe primary risk is that the stock moves sideways or declines, resulting in a loss of the net premium paid. While the strategy is robust for a moderate bullish move, it is crucial to note that the maximum profit is capped at the width of the strikes minus the net debit. Furthermore, with the current low IV Rank, there is a risk that volatility could increase, which would generally benefit long options, but since this is a debit spread, the overall impact of a volatility shift is muted compared to a single long call. We will monitor the stock's price action closely, as the trade requires the underlying to move above the long strike of $220.00 to become profitable.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"Bull Call Spread\",\n  \"legs\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"BUY\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 220.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.566353484126753\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"SELL\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 230.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.27946831473288913\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
