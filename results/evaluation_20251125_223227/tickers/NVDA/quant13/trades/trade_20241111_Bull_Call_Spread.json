    "notes": "Subject: Trade Recommendation: Bull Call Spread on [Underlying Asset]\n\nDear [Client Name],\n\nOur current market thesis is **Bullish** with a medium conviction, anticipating moderate upward movement in the underlying asset from its current price of $145.22. To capitalize on this outlook while managing capital efficiently, we recommend initiating a **Bull Call Spread**. This strategy perfectly aligns with our directional bias because it is a defined-risk, defined-reward play designed to profit specifically from an increase in the asset's price. By buying the lower strike call ($145.00) and simultaneously selling the higher strike call ($155.00), we establish a net debit position that maximizes our return if the stock closes above the higher strike at expiration, while significantly reducing the initial cost compared to buying a naked call.\n\nThe structure of this trade involves buying the $145.00 Call (which is near the money) and selling the $155.00 Call (out of the money). The maximum profit potential is capped at the difference between the strikes ($10.00) minus the net premium paid. The maximum risk is limited to the net premium paid upfront. Since the IV Rank is relatively low (28.1) and volatility is forecasted to be stable, the Bull Call Spread is an appropriate choice as it benefits from upward price movement without requiring a significant surge in implied volatility. The $145.00 strike acts as our primary directional bet, while the sale of the $155.00 strike helps finance the purchase and defines our profit ceiling.\n\nThe key risk in this strategy is that the underlying asset fails to move above the $145.00 strike, resulting in a loss equal to the premium paid. Furthermore, if the asset moves strongly higher, our profit is capped at the $155.00 strike, meaning we would miss out on any gains above that level. We must monitor the price action closely, particularly around the $145.00 level, as a sustained move above this point is necessary for the trade to become profitable. Given the defined risk profile, this spread offers a balanced way to express our medium-conviction bullish view.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"Bull Call Spread\",\n  \"legs\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"BUY\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 145.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.543254072184017\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"SELL\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 155.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.3166452784333564\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
