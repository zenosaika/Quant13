    "notes": "Subject: Trade Recommendation: Bull Call Spread on [Underlying Ticker]\n\nDear [Client Name],\n\nBased on our medium-conviction **Bullish thesis** for the underlying asset, we recommend initiating a **Bull Call Spread**. This strategy is perfectly suited for a moderately bullish outlook where we anticipate a move higher but want to cap our risk and reduce the upfront cost compared to buying a naked call. Given the current price of $135.98, this spread allows us to profit if the stock moves above our lower strike of $140.00, while defining our maximum potential gain and loss upfront.\n\nThe proposed structure involves **buying the 140.0 Call** and simultaneously **selling the 145.0 Call**. This creates a defined-risk, defined-reward vertical spread with a width of $5.00. By selling the higher strike call, we finance part of the purchase of the lower strike call, significantly reducing the net debit required to enter the trade. Our maximum profit is achieved if the stock closes at or above $145.00 at expiration, and our maximum loss is limited to the net premium paid (the debit) for the spread. This structure is capital-efficient and aligns well with the current IV Rank of 60.0, as it mitigates the impact of high implied volatility on the net cost of the position.\n\nWhile the Bull Call Spread is a conservative bullish play, the key risk remains the directional movement of the stock. If the underlying asset fails to move above the 140.0 strike, the trade will expire worthless, resulting in the loss of the entire net debit paid. Furthermore, since we are selling an option, we are short volatility (Vega negative), meaning a sharp drop in implied volatility could negatively impact the spread's value, though this effect is generally muted in vertical spreads. We will monitor the stock's price action closely, particularly its ability to breach the $140.00 level, as this is the critical point for the trade to become profitable.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"Bull Call Spread\",\n  \"legs\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"BUY\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 140.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.44292572389667656\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"SELL\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 145.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.3326972267638648\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
