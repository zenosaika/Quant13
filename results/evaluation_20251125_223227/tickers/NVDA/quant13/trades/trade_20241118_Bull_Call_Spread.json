    "notes": "## Trade Rationale: Bull Call Spread on [Underlying Asset]\n\nGood morning. Based on our medium-conviction bullish thesis for the underlying asset, currently trading at $140.11, we are recommending a **Bull Call Spread**. This strategy is a highly efficient way to capitalize on a moderate upward move while defining our maximum risk, which is particularly suitable given the current low IV Rank of 18.0, suggesting options are relatively inexpensive.\n\nThe structure of the trade involves **buying the 140-strike Call** (near the money) and simultaneously **selling the 150-strike Call** (out of the money). This creates a net debit position. By buying the lower strike, we establish our primary bullish exposure; by selling the higher strike, we partially finance the purchase and cap our maximum profit at the difference between the strikes minus the net debit paid. This spread is designed to profit if the underlying asset moves above $140.00, achieving maximum profitability if it closes at or above $150.00 by expiration.\n\nThe primary risk is the loss of the net premium paid if the stock remains flat or moves lower. Since this is a defined-risk strategy, our maximum loss is strictly limited to the initial debit. We are comfortable with this structure because it aligns perfectly with our expectation of a moderate rise\u2014we don't need the stock to skyrocket to profit significantly. We will monitor the underlying price action closely. If the stock approaches $150.00 well before expiration, we may consider closing the spread early to lock in profits, as the remaining time value on the short 150-strike call will begin to decay rapidly.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy\": \"Bull Call Spread\",\n  \"legs\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"BUY\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 140.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.5406397992897776\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"SELL\",\n      \"type\": \"CALL\",\n      \"strike\": 150.0,\n      \"delta\": 0.30194586392532385\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
